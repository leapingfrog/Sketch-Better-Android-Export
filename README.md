Sketch-Better-Android-Export
============================

A plugin for Sketch to export layers for Android. Supports transparency, 1x and 2x base sizes, and has been tested against Sketch 41.

TIP: If everything is exporting as a solid rectangle, you probably need to select the artboard and UNCHECK "Include in Export" (in reference to the background color).
